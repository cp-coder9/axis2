   - Accessible via `/freelancer/earnings` route

4. **FreelancerApplicationsPage** (`src/pages/FreelancerApplicationsPage.tsx`)
   - Project applications management
   - Uses FreelancerProjectApplicationWidget
   - Accessible via `/freelancer/applications` route

### 4. Router Updates (`src/Router.tsx`)

#### Changes:

  - `/freelancer/earnings`
  - `/freelancer/applications`
  - `/client/projects` (already existed)
  - `/client/files` (already existed)

### 5. Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard (`src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.tsx`) was already complete with:
- Overview tab with quick stats
- User Management tab with RoleManagementPanel
- Activity Monitor tab with UserActivityMonitor
- Analytics tab with SystemAnalytics

No changes were needed for the Admin Dashboard.

## Reusable Components Utilized

### Freelancer Components:
- `ProjectTable` - Displays projects with timer controls
- `FreelancerTimerWidget` - Active timer with start/pause/stop
- `FreelancerEarningsDashboard` - Complete earnings analytics
- `FreelancerProjectApplicationWidget` - Project applications management

### Client Components:
- `ClientProjectOverview` - Project list with status tracking
- `ClientMessagingInterface` - Real-time messaging system
- `ClientFileAccessSystem` - Secure file management

### Shared Components:
- `ModernDashboardCard` - Animated stat cards with trends
- `AnimatedStatCard` - Performance metric displays
- Various UI components from shadcn/ui

## Key Features

### Data Integration:
- All components use `useAppContext()` to access application state
- Projects are filtered based on user role and assignments
- Mock data is provided for demonstration where real API would be used

### User Experience:
- Consistent design across all dashboards
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Responsive layouts for mobile and desktop

### Navigation:
- Dashboard tabs for quick access to different sections
- Standalone pages accessible via sidebar navigation
- Proper role-based access control via `AuthGuard`
- Breadcrumb navigation support

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Login as Freelancer and verify all dashboard tabs work
- [ ] Navigate to standalone freelancer pages via sidebar
- [ ] Login as Client and verify all dashboard tabs work
- [ ] Navigate to client pages via sidebar  
- [ ] Login as Admin and verify dashboard is functional
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify proper loading states
- [ ] Check empty states when no data available
- [ ] Test timer functionality
- [ ] Verify project table filtering works correctly

### Known Limitations:
- Mock data is used for demonstration purposes
- Real API integration needed for production
- Timer persistence needs backend support
- File upload/download needs actual storage integration
